This repository contains a computer vision project focused on detecting individuals smoking using deep learning techniques. The project leverages the YOLOv8 model for real-time object detection, ensuring high accuracy and efficiency in identifying smoking behavior from images and videos. The dataset that has been used is aqcuired through the use of roboflow and with the help of Google Collab to train the model.

The weights of the model can be tested and is uploaded to https://universe.roboflow.com/three-musketeers/cigarette-detection-2ao2c/model/3
