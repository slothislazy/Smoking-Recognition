This repository contains a computer vision project focused on detecting individuals smoking using deep learning techniques. The project leverages the YOLOv8 model for real-time object detection, ensuring high accuracy and efficiency in identifying smoking behavior from images and videos.

The weights of the model can be tested and is uploaded to https://universe.roboflow.com/three-musketeers/cigarette-detection-2ao2c/model/3
